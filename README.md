Midoku Audiobook Player
=======================

This project was, for the most part, a playground for C++ Meta programming and QtQuick.

Some highlights:
- Template-based QtSql/SQLite ORM
- Building Qt metaobjects from type traits using C++ metaprogramming
- Rust-esque Result type
- Map operations over heterogenous tuples/sequences of types

It is not currently actively developed, but it is a somewhat useable MVP.
